Transcriber’s Notes


Simple typographical errors were corrected.

Punctuation and spelling were made consistent when a predominant
preference was found in the original book; otherwise they were not
changed.

This picture book has no Table of Contents or page numbers. The first
illustration, "Washington Album," is the cover.

In the Plain Text version of this eBook, the sequences of indentifiers
in some captions have been changed by placing the primary identifiers
first.

Three illustrations included a small inset image in the
upper-right-hand corner. That format and the associated captions have
been preserved here, rather than identifying the insets as separate
illustrations.
